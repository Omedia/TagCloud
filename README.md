TagCloud
===============

This module enables users to easily create and configure TagCloud blocks based on ANY vocabulary existed in drupal system.
Font sizes are calculated by logarithmic method, thus, output is quite beautiful.

There are no other requirements for this module's basic functionality.


Installation
=============

- Download and extract your module in your sites/all/modules/tagcloud folder.

- Enable it through the administration area (admin/modules) or through drush (drush -y pm-enable tagcloud).


Usage
==========

- Navigate to admin/structure/block and you will see another tab "Add TagCloud block" with standard "Add Block".
